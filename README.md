# Lucas Rigolo Ortiz de Camargo
Graduated in chemical engineering and currently focus on areas related to data analysis, based on concepts of big data, programing languages and machine learnig. 

I had one year experience, with maintenance database analysis, only using excel and Power Point, in the food/beverage industry. These year of experience, provide an opportunity to undertand the importance of a complete database analysis, to provide the appropriate solution, that fits perfectly to the case presented.

**Background:** Work on it.
